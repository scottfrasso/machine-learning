# Machine Learning / AI Projects

I'm doing a course in Machine Learning / AI.

## Project #1 Job Data

Take a look at my first project with [parsing job data to predict salaries](./1_job_data/Job-Data-Scraping-and-ML-Dataset-Creation.md)

## Project #2 Heart Disease model hosted on GCP

In my second project I created a [Heart Disease classifier and hosted it on GCP in a low-cost/no-cost way.](./2_heart_disease/Heart-Disease-Classifier-Hosted-on-GCP.md) you can also [see how I hosted it in GCP here](https://github.com/scottfrasso/host-a-model).
