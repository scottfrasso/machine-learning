# Machine Learning / AI Projects

I'm doing a course in Machine Learning / AI.

## Project #1 Job Data

Take a look at my first project with [parsing job data to predict salaries](./1_job_data/Job-Data-Scraping-and-ML-Dataset-Creation.md)

## Project #2 Heart Disease model hosted on GCP

In my second project I created a [Heart Disease classifier and hosted it on GCP in a low-cost/no-cost way.](./2_heart_disease/Heart-Disease-Classifier-Hosted-on-GCP.md) you can also [see how I hosted it in GCP here](https://github.com/scottfrasso/host-a-model).

## Project #3

For my third project I started working on a [Time Series prediciton compeition that is an open compeition on Kaggle](./3_time_series_kaggle_comp/Time-series-sales-Kaggle-competition.ipynb). This is the first time I've worked with time series data and it's something I'm interested in so I figured I'd try my hand at this open competition on Kaggle by working with the first 2 years of data in the set and working up to eventually submitting something to Kaggle itself to see where I land on the leaderboard.
